# my-e-commerce-store
- E-commerce store back end through the modification of starter-code

## Description
- The motivation for this project was to build the back-end for an e-commerce retail site through the configuration of a working Express.js API in order to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQl database. 
- This project was built to understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites considering they are so prevalent. I could use this project to showcase my abilities to possible employers in the internet retail and/or to e-commerce platforms. Furthermore, I could utilize this application in the future to, coupled with all my coding skills after the completion of this course, create a platform for selling items myself. 
- This project was built using Express.js 4.17.1, Sequelize 5.21.7, MySQL2 2.1.0, Nodemon 2.3.3, Dotenv 8.2.0, Node.js, Postman and JavaScript.
- Challenges with this project arose mostly with the POST route in the product-routes.js file.
- There was also a syntax error in the Category.js file on line 11, which was causing erros in the terminal. Once this error was fixed, the terminal issues were resolved. 
- I learned how to implement CRUD operations to create, delete and update products on an e-commerce retail site. I also gained familarity with Postman. 
- Future devlopment for this project will be creating a front end for use in the browser.
