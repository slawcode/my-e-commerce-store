# my-e-commerce-store
- E-commerce store back end through the modification of starter-code

## Description
- The motivation for this project was to build the back-end for an e-commerce retail site through the configuration of a working Express.js API in order to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQl database. 
- This project was built to understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites considering they are so prevalent. Furthermore, I could use this project to showcase my abilities to possible employers in the internet retail and/or to e-commerce platforms.  
- This project was built using Express.js 4.17.1, Sequelize 5.21.7, MySQL2 2.1.0, Nodemon 2.0.3, Dotenv 8.2.0, Node.js and JavaScript.
- Challenges...
